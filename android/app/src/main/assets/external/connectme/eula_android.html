            asserted directly by you or Evernym. To be clear, the User and Evernym both waive any right to participate in any class action involving disputes between us.</p>
          <p>You and Evernym expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</p>
          <p>User agrees that any claim and/or cause of action related to this Agreement or the use of the Software must be filed within one (1) year after the cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
          <p>12. INDEMNITY AND RELEASE. When the User downloads, accesses, and/or uses the Application, the User shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Evernym and its owners, shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, partners,
